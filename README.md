# Windows-Firewall-with-Advanced-Security


This whole project provided a comprehensive understanding of the configuration and management of Windows Firewall using both the standard and advanced options of Windows Defender Firewall. Through the guide and scenarios, the following key skills were developed: 

Enabling and Verifying Firewall Settings: 

Understanding the roles of Domain, Private, and Public network profiles and their impact on system security. 

Verifying and adjusting settings for allowed applications through the firewall. 

Configuring Basic and Advanced Rules: 

Blocking and allowing specific inbound and outbound traffic using port and application-specific rules. 

Restricting Remote Desktop and HTTP traffic on Public networks to enhance security. 

Managing application-level traffic restrictions to control outbound network behavior. 

Scenario-Specific Rules for Enhanced Security: 

Customizing rules for unique organizational needs, such as blocking or allowing specific services (e.g., Remote Desktop and KMS) under defined profiles. 

Demonstrating how advanced firewall rules can be tailored for specific network conditions, increasing security without sacrificing necessary functionality. 

Key Takeaways: 

Flexibility and Control: Windows Firewall with Advanced Security provides granular control over inbound and outbound traffic, allowing administrators to implement strict security policies without hindering necessary communication. 

Scenario-Specific Rule Application: Tailoring rules to match network profiles ensures that different network conditions (e.g., Public vs. Private) are managed with appropriate security policies. 

Efficient Troubleshooting: The project illustrated how to enable and disable rules as needed, demonstrating efficient ways to verify configurations and resolve network access issues. 

By following this guide, users can gainpractical knowledge and hands-on experience in managing network traffic and securing Windows systems through Windows Defender Firewall. This foundational skill set is critical for IT professionals tasked with ensuring organizational and endpoint security.
